###  Unicode Basics

Quote from [JavaScript has a Unicode problem](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode):

Before we take a closer look at JavaScript, let‚Äôs make sure we‚Äôre all on the same page when it comes to Unicode.

It‚Äôs easiest to think of Unicode as a database that maps any symbol you can think of to a number called its code point, and to a unique name. That way, it‚Äôs easy to refer to specific symbols without actually using the symbol itself. Examples:

* A is U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A.
* a is U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A.
* ¬© is U+00A9 COPYRIGHT SIGN.
* ‚òÉ is U+2603 SNOWMAN.
* üí© is U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO.

Code points are usually formatted as hexadecimal numbers, zero-padded up to at least four digits, with a U+ prefix.

The possible code point values range from U+0000 to U+10FFFF. That‚Äôs over 1.1 million possible symbols. To keep things organised, Unicode divides this range of code points into 17 planes that consist of about 65 thousand code points each.

The first plane (U+0000 ‚Üí U+FFFF) and is called the **Basic Multilingual Plane** or **BMP**, and it‚Äôs probably the most important one, as it contains all the most commonly used symbols. Most of the time you don‚Äôt need any code points outside of the BMP for text documents in English. Just like any other Unicode plane, it groups about 65 thousand symbols.

That leaves us about 1 million other code points (U+010000 ‚Üí U+10FFFF) that live outside the BMP. The planes these code points belong to are called **supplementary planes**, or **astral planes**.

Astral code points are pretty easy to recognize: if you need more than 4 hexadecimal digits to represent the code point, it‚Äôs an astral code point.

### [Strings and character codes](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#code_units)

Strings, too, have to be modeled as a series of bits to be able to
exist inside the computer. The way JavaScript does this is based
on the Unicode standard. This standard assigns a number to virtually
every character you would ever need, including characters from
Greek, Arabic, Japanese, Armenian, and so on. If we have a number
for every character, a string can be described by a sequence of
numbers.

And that‚Äôs what JavaScript does. 

But there‚Äôs a complication: 

**JavaScript‚Äôs representation uses 16 bits per string element, and there are more than 2^16 different characters in Unicode** (about twice as many, at this point). 
El rango del c√≥digo Unicode va del 0 al 1,114,111. Los primeros 128 c√≥digos de Unicode encajan directamente con los c√≥digos de caract√©res de la codificaci√≥n ASCII. 

So some characters, such as many emoji, take up two ‚Äúcharacter positions‚Äù in JavaScript strings.

JavaScript strings are encoded as a sequence of 16-bit numbers.
These are called **code units**. 

A **code unit** is the number of bits an encoding uses. So UTF-8 would
use 8 and UTF-16 would use 16 units. 

A **code point** is a character and this is represented by one or more code units depending on the
encoding.

A Unicode character code was initially supposed to fit within such a **unit**
(which gives you a little over 65 thousand characters). 

When it became clear that wasn‚Äôt going to be enough, many people balked at
the need to use more memory per character. 

To address these concerns, UTF-16, the format used by JavaScript strings, was invented. 

It describes most common characters using a single 16-bit code unit,
but uses a pair of two such units for others.

**UTF-16 is generally considered a bad idea today.**

It seems almost intentionally designed to invite mistakes. 

* It‚Äôs easy to write programs that pretend code units and characters are the same thing.
* And if your natural language doesn‚Äôt use two-unit characters, that will
appear to work just fine ... But as soon as someone tries to use such
a program with some less common Chinese characters, it breaks.
* Fortunately, with the advent of emoji, everybody has started using
two-unit characters, and the burden of dealing with such problems
is more fairly distributed.
* Unfortunately, obvious operations on JavaScript strings, such as
getting their `length` through the `length` property and accessing their
content using square brackets, deal only with code units.
